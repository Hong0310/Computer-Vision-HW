You will need to use your Stony Brook (*.stonybrook.edu) account for coding and Google Drive to save your results.\n","\n","## Google Colab Tutorial\n","---\n","Go to https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/, you will see a tutorial named \"Welcome to Colaboratory\" file, where you can learn the basics of using google colab.\n","\n","Settings used for assignments: ***Edit -> Notebook Settings -> Runtime Type (Python 3)***.\n","---\n","\n","## Tracking algorithm description\n","\n","This assignment is based on SiamFC [1] Tracking. The basic idea of [1] is to learn a similarity measurement between target and search space using deep Siamese network. With the learned similarity measurement, both target localization and target scale estimation will be performed on it. In addition, no model update is performed during tracking. **More details can be found in the original paper [1].**\n","\n","## Your task\n","\n","In this assignment, you will find two problems.\n","1. The first one is a standard SiamFC based tracking algorithm. It will be given with several parts incompleted (e.g., the function loading sequence for tracking). You need to complete these parts and make the full tracking algorithm work. \n","2. Second one is based on RGB-Thermal Tracking. In this tracking problem, you will additionally have a Thermal channel alongside the RGB(visible spectrum) image in the video sequences. You need to use this additional information to your advantage to aid the tracking. Again, few missing sections of the code have to be completed here.   \n","\n","\n","The incompleted parts will be like this:\n","\n","  \\# description of requirement for this part\n","\n","  \\##########--WRITE YOUR CODE HERE--##########\n","\n","  ...\n","\n","  \\##########-------END OF CODE-------##########\n","\n","**NOTE: the pretrained SiamFC model is given, and you just need to use the pretrained model to finish the tracking algorithm.**\n","\n","\n","[1] Fully-Convolutional Siamese Networks for Object Tracking, ECCVW, 2016.\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tbTKqoSyJOzv"},"source":["#Environment set up and data preparation\n","\n","\n","\n","1.   **Install PyTorch 1.1.0 and Pillow 6.0.0.**\n","\n","  Please install PyTorch 1.1.0 using the following command (By default, latest version of PyTorch is installed on CoLab.
